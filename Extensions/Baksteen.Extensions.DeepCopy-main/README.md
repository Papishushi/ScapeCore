# C# extension method for fast object cloning.

This is a speed-optimized fork of Alexey Burtsev's deep copier. Depending on your usecase, this will be 2x - 3x faster than the original. It also fixes some bugs which are present in the original code. Compared to the classic binary serialization/deserialization deep clone technique, this version is about seven times faster (the more arrays your objects contain, the bigger the speedup factor).

The speedup is achieved via the following techniques:

- object reflection results are cached
- don't deep copy primitives or immutable structs & classes (e.g. enum and string)
- to improve locality of reference, process the 'fast' dimensions or multidimensional arrays in the __inner__ loops
- use a compiled lamba expression to call MemberwiseClone

## How to use:

Use NuGet package manager to add the package [Baksteen.Extensions.DeepCopy](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Baksteen.Extensions.DeepCopy) to your project. Then:

    using Baksteen.Extensions.DeepCopy;
    ...
    var myobject = new SomeClass();
    ...
    var myclone = myobject.DeepCopy()!;    // creates a new deep copy of the original object 

Note: the exclamation mark (null-forgiving operator) is only required if you enabled nullable reference types in your project
